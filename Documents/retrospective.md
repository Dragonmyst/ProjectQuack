# Development Retrospective
- Time: 
  - I work during the day and was moving during the week and weekend. So I had to fit time in where I could.
- Database on Mac: 
  - I have never developed anything on my mac that required a database. For work I use a windows machine and SSMS. 
- Azure MySQL:
  - While I have used MySQL before I have never setup and used it within Azure. It took a bit of document reading and troubleshooting to properly set it up and create a database/tables.
- Azure Static Web App's Functions integration with Azure MySQL
  - There wasn't a whole lot of documentation on this. It was a lot of troubleshooting. I was hoping to make it more secure than it is but to get it working I had to make access more public.
- React Unit Testing:
  - It has been quite a few years since I have done React unit testing. My current place of employment does not do unit testing. I thought it would be no problem to remeber how to do it. However, it seems unit testing has really changed since the last time I have done it. Lesson learned is not to leave it till last, so I have time to read up and relearn. 
- Styling:
  - I love playing with styling too much and tend to get carried away looking up different ways of doing things. I needed to either timebox and set an alarm, or leave it till last and get functionality working first.
